# Eyedentify
YRHacks 2023 project

Eyedentify is a web app for completing attendances of large classrooms with facial recognition.

## How it Works
From the Eyedentify app, the user is able to create an attendance sheet with the faces of students. When it is time to do attendance, the user submits a picture containing some of the students and the app automatically marks off who is present.
